**VMinus** is a mod that can edit, remove, and replace items, blocks, entities, and more (vanilla or modded) with simple json files. It can be done data-driven which is the first of its kind, but also optionally config driven if you do not understand datapacks. VMinus also has the capability within these jsons, to allow for global, tagged, and conditional modification to dynamically edit many features at once.

Originally used mcreator, majority ported over and rewritten by now.
